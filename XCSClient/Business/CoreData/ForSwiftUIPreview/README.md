# CoreData generated files
There is an issue (bug?) in SwiftUI Previews, which display an error for CoreData objects, if the code is autogenerated.
It then complains, that it cannot find the class, because the class is auto generated into the DerivedData folder.
While the preview itself works, there are errors displayed.

Solution is to set CDIntegration and CDBot to only autogenerate the properties extensions and have the classes themselves added to the project.
